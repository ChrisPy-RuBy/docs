Social distanced classes: What are the legal requirements. I'm not sure.
	- currently 3 households. 8 people in total. 

One or more of the following.....
- online? or in person?
	- issues with online.
		- lack of space. 
		- lack of social interaction.  not fufilling the
- reduced class sizes but still rotate.
- only one partner 
- protective clothing?
- change the dance so there is reduced touching

Diffiulties we might face
- people that don't have a partner. 
- number balance.
- legal requirements
	- from 31 july: indoor events allowed with social distancing
	
1) How can we take advantage of the dance practices we’ve developed during lockdown? What are some of the positive things we’ve gained during this time? (Think about musicality, solo dancing, creativity, community, music appreciation, the freedom of dancing in your living-room with no one watching…!).

- A. I guess the answer is more solo dancing. Shadow boxing etc. V.limited space so only dancing when no one is looking
	- learning how to count in on your own.
	- 

2) How might we apply some of these things to our teaching - especially Level 1? What might be the benefits of a socially distanced class for students’ dancing? (Think about confidence, rhythm, creativity, etc.) 

- A) Smaller class sizes means more focused teacher attention. Same partner means better chance to work on stuff for longer periods. Have someone to do homework with.
	- make your own class type experience, share a play list

3) Thinking about the benefits of socially distanced classes, what formats, practicalities and exercises can we experiment with to accommodate this style of class. 

- A) Lots more space, big swing outs, aerial classes etc. The opposite of floor craft. 

4) Given the continuing conversations about the social history and African American cultural context of swing dance and music, this is a good moment to revisit the Core Value “Roots.” What do we mean by “Roots” and how are we integrating this in our teaching? What are some ways we might improve this - especially for Level 1?

- A) Visual explanation rather than verbal.
	- pictures images in class. O sensei.

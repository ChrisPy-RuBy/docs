# algebra

#### **perfect square**

$$
x^2 + 2bx + b^2 = (x+b)^2
$$

# probabilty


#### **Rule of Completement**


$$
P(A^c) = 1 - P(A)
$$

The probabilty something doesn't happen, minus the probability that it does

e.g.
A six-sided dice is rolled
prob of a 1, 2. either sum (1, 2) or 1- sum(3-6)

hard example
prob that 1 of 3 six sided dice rolls a 6.
prob 1 dice not roll a 6 = 5/6 
3 dice (5/6)^3
1 - (5/6)^3

# functions

## **adeffect**

$$
tv-factor = \frac{tv-coeff}{1-adstock}
$$

## logistic curve 


logistic s-shape curves

$$
F(x) = \frac{L}{1 + e^{-k(x-x_0)}}
$$

where L is the max in Y
-k is the curve slop
x0 is th curve midpoint

FIND ALL HOSTS ON A LOCAL NETWORK

>>>nmap -sP '192.168.1.*'
Get hostname ip
>>> hostname -I
IP Addresses
>>> ip -4 addr show | grep global

> inet 192.168.1.145/24 brd 192.168.1.255 scope global eth0

First address is pi. /24 is number of potential devices I think.
Second address is brd or broadcast address of network
Router address
>>>ip route | grep default | awk '{print $3}'
192.168.1.254
DNS Server
What the fuck is a DNS server

>>> cat /etc/resolv.conf
> # Generated by resolvconf
domain home
nameserver 192.168.1.254
WPA_config doc
Seems to be a doc filled with router address and password
>>>/etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf


ctrl_interface=DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=netdev
update_config=1
country=GB

network={
        ssid="routername"
        psk="routerpassword"
        key_mgmt=WPA-PSK
}


SETTING A STATIC IP ADDRESS ON WIFI
https://www.raspberrypi.org/learning/networking-lessons/rpi-static-ip-address/

Just added 192.168.1.88
But this stops out going traffic via my router

So just set it via the router instead
See

Basics

Become Root User
>>> sudo su

Stop being root User
>>> exit

Operating system type
>>>cat /etc/os-release
Login in root
>>> sudo -s

Generate ssh key  
>>> xclip -sel clip < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
Show all modules used
>>> lsmod
SSH 
SSH to a pi on local network without password or key
>>> ssh pi@dingleberry.local
SETUP SSH KEY into Pi

Terminal 
>>> sudo raspi-config
    -> interfaces
    -> enable ssh
CHANGE HOSTNAME

Terminal 
>>> sudo raspi-config
-> interfaces
-> change hostname
ADD SSH KEY TO PI
https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/remote-access/ssh/passwordless.md

Public key lives in .ssh as rsa_pub
>>> ssh-copy-id <name>@hostname
Will ask for password
